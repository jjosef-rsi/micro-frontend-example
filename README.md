# Micro-frontend Example

This is an example of a React app utilizing a micro-frontend strategy.

# How to use it

You'll need 3 terminals open, one for `container`, one for `menu`, and one for `orders`.

Run the command `yarn start` for each.

Then a bunch of windows will open in your browser. You only need the localhost:3000 one.
